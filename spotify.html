                <div class="projectdesc">
                    I was tasked with implementing a new feature onto an already-existing application. I chose to create a Social page to the Spotify mobile app, where users can share songs with each other and keep track of all the music that’s been shared between them.

                <h3 class="projectSection">Research</h3>
                <div class="projectdesc">
                    My process was based on research I performed, asking mobile music app-users their opinions on how they currently share music, how they would like to share music, and what they think of the Spotify user experience. I also prepared for this project by extensively browsing the Spotify app, making sure I understand the way the app works, from screen movement to the actions allowed by all the menu options, so I could correctly recreate the app.

                <div class="projectdesc">
                    I used Figma to recreate the current Spotify visual design and to add a few ways to share a song with another user. This includes creating 25 different sample iPhone screens showing different parts of the app and my newly-designed music-sharing process. The Social page has a list of the user’s friends, and each friend’s page has a Shared Music section, where the user can find a list of all the music they have shared with that friend, and where they can either recommend a song to that friend or request a song from that friend. The user can also recommend a song from the song menu which the user can access from anywhere on the app.                </div>
