                    The NYU Ability Project supports research in assistive technology and adaptive design for people with disabilities. My groupâ€™s goal was to create an accessible and extensible tactile musical interface that can support the music-making process of people with a diverse range of abilities.

                    We were working with the Specdrums: easy-to-use rings developed by Sphero that produce sounds when tapped on different-colored surfaces. However, the lack of an API for the Specdrums means they required the official app, which has limited functionality.

                    I learned about Bluetooth Low Energy, its organization of data, and how devices can be accessed by and connected to other devices. This included learning about the GAP (Generic Access Profile) and GATT (Generic Attribute Profile), and how a client can read or write data from a server, using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to access these services and characteristics.

                    My team developed an API that connects the Specdrums to Google Chrome via Bluetooth. My job was to parse all the data in the Specdrums and translate it into MIDI, and to create a Tone.js synth instrument that takes the data from the Specdrums and plays the corresponding notes and chords.
